Learn Python - files from python course
These are the files for learning python

The pydoc function provides instructions on how to use python

In the terminal - python3 -m pydoc <name>

1.  ex1.py - Printing
2.  ex2.py - Comments
3.  ex3.py - Simple maths
4.  ex4.py - Printing with variables
5.  ex5.py - Formatting strings (f"{}") and .format
6.  ex6.py - Formatting strings within strings
7.  ex7.py - concatenate strings
8.  ex8.py - Printing with .format
9.  ex9.py - Printing with carriage return (escape)
10. ex10.py - Escape characters - Documentation includes escape sequences
11. ex11.py - Using input to take variable and then format in a print strings
12. ex12.pu - Using input to take variables and applying print(f"") to format the strings
13. ex13.py - Using the argv module to pass paramaters when the script is being run. Paramaters are then passed to variables https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
14. ex14.py - Takes a paramater using argv followed by other argements after the script is running using the 'prompt' function.
15.  Using the argv and input functions, pass a filename for a txt file
to open and read using the read() function.  The contents of the file are
printed to the console.
16. Using both the argv and input functions create, open, read and write data to a txt file.  Excercise includes target txt file.  Additional excercise 'ex16_sd.py' is reading the file content and writing to the console.
17.  This script takes two arguments, a 'from file' and a 'to file'.  The contents of the 'from file' are written to the 'to file'.  This script also introduces the os.path exists method, which checks if a file exists.
18.  This script defines several functions each requirement 0 or many arguments and prints these to the console.
19.  This script creates several functions which require arguments.  These combine different ways of passing arguments.
20.  This scripts creates several functions which process a file which is passed as part of running the script with argv.
21.  This script creates several function which take a variety of arguments
and then returns a result.  The result is then used in other math.
22.  Review - no code.
23.  The script introduces strings, bytes and character encoding and error handling.  It requires the 'languages.txt' file to run.
